- Correctness/completeness
  - implement await/resume
  - pass all jit-tests

- Performance
  - PBL-hybrid for all "slower than baseline" ops
    - unary, binary ops
    - GetElem/SetElem? Or at least fastpaths
    - monomorphize the interpreter on a bool template param and select
      at entry which option to take
  - implement CallScriptedFunction for ctors
  - implement as many CacheIR ops as needed to completely cover markdown renderer
  - OSR (on-stack replacement)
  - implement direct-threaded opts in Wasmtime/Cranelift

- Wasm
  - on wasm and other 32-bit platforms: make StackVal properly push
    32-bit values? stick to 64-bit layout for BaselineFrame,
    JitFrameLayout, etc?
  - weval the IC interp and PBL interp loops
    - memory-rename the stack and icVals too

- Tests
  - markdown
  - Octane
