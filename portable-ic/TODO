- implement await/resume

- pass all jit-tests

- implement as many CacheIR ops as needed to completely cover markdown renderer
- opts:
  - "next-op fusion": cover a few likely next ops with if-goto
    - for bonus points, make these edges acyclic; then the wasm compilation can
      handle it too without any loop-backedges
  - cover a few common cases (e.g. int32 compare/arith) without doing ICs at all
  - cache unchanging values (stubInfo?) as needed

- weval the IC interp and PBL interp loops
  - memory-rename the stack and icVals too
