- implement await/resume

-     // TODO: from BaselineIC.cpp:1812:
      // If this is a |constructing| call, if the callee returns a non-object, we
      // replace it with the |this| object passed in.

- start to implement interpreter for CacheIR
  - (X) u64 array for "registers" / operandIDs
  - (X) tail (post-IC-return) dispatch and fallback dispatch based on
    "IC kind" state
  - use *only* icVals; don't use the rooted storage in `state` unless
    we go to the fallback. (Avoid some data movement and the barriers
    too.)
